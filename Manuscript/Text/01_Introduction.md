# Introduction

- The common gamma chain cytokine family is central to regulation of the immune system
- Many receptor families are composed of multiple ligands, receptors, and cell populations

- Efforts to engineer gc behavior and/or gc treatments
    - [@ring_mechanistic_2012]
- Efforts to model behavior of cytokine families
    - Modeling that doesn't account for trafficking
        - Model of T cell proliferative response to IL-2 and IL-4. [@BURKE199742]
        - High level model of how IL-2 feedback loops regulate T cell populations. [@Feinerman437]
    - Modeling that accounts for trafficking
        - Accounting for trafficking allows for more accurate ligand depletion and cell proliferation model in case of IL-2. [@Fallon2000]
    - Focused on competition for common gamma chain
        - Showed how high IL2Ra abundnaces lowered the IL-2 EC50 but dampened the signaling responses of IL-7 and IL-15. Their work was mostly experimental (flow cytometry)  [@Cotarira17]
