## Tensor Factorization Maps Response-Space of the Gamma Chain Family

![**Tensor factorization to map possible cytokine response.** A) Schematic representation of Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (also known as CP or PARAFAC).  B) Average experimental receptor level measurements in units #/cell for IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, γ~c~, and IL-15Rα on 8 cell types. C) $R^2X$ using PARAFAC plotted against the number of components decomposed into. D) Timepoint decomposition plot showing component values against time for each factorization component after decomposing the tensor into 4 components. E,G) Decomposition plot along the second (cell) dimension showing the eight cell type values along each component.  F,H) Ligand decomposition plot along third dimension revealing each ligand according to its shape and concentration reflected by color.](./Figures/figure3.svg){#fig:tfac}
