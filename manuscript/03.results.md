### Bivalent Fc-cytokine fusions have distinct cell specificity but not dynamics

Exploring how dynamic responses vary across responding cell types and ligand treatments is challenging due to the multi-dimensional contributions to differences in response. Restricting ones' view to a single time point, cell type, or ligand concentration provides only a slice of the picture [@DOI:10.1101/778894; @DOI:10.1101/2021.01.03.425138]. Therefore, we applied tensor factorization as a way to separate the contribution of each dimension in overall response.

We arranged our profiling experiments into a four-dimensional tensor, with each dimension varying the ligand used, treatment concentration, treatment duration, or cell type used in the profiling. We then factored this data using non-negative, canonical polyadic decomposition to derive factors summarizing the influence of each dimension. Three components explained roughly 90% of the variance within the dataset.

As we have seen before [@DOI:10.1101/778894], tensor factorization clearly separated the contribution of each dimension into each factor, and distinct responses into separate components. Component 1 almost exclusively represented responses in the cytokines that were not Fc-conjugated (Fig. [@fig:tfac]c) at high concentrations (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d). Its response was not cell specific across the four cell populations (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e) and relatively transient (Fig. [@fig:tfac]f). Interestingly, the remaining two components partly separated by whether cytokines were Fc-fused in a monovalent or bivalent form (Fig. [@fig:tfac]c), with the bivalent cytokines weighted more strongly by component 2, and the monovalent forms on component 3. Component 2 explained responses almost exclusive to regulatory T cells (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e) at lower concentrations (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d), while component 3 had a broad response (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e) and increased with concentration (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d). Despite these strong differences in specificities, and a difference in the timing for an initial response, both components were similarly sustained on longer timescales (Fig. [@fig:tfac]f).
