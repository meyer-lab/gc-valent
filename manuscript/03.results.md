Exploring how dynamic responses vary across responding cell types and ligand treatments is challenging due to the multi-dimensional contributions to differences in response. Restricting ones' view to a single time point, cell type, or ligand concentration provides only a slice of the picture [@DOI:10.1101/778894; @DOI:10.1101/2021.01.03.425138]. Therefore, we applied tensor factorization as a way to separate the contribution of each dimension in overall response.

We arranged our profiling experiments into a four-dimensional tensor, with each dimension varying the ligand used, treatment concentration, treatment duration, or cell type used in the profiling. We then factored this data using non-negative, canonical polyadic decomposition to derive factors summarizing the influence of each dimension. Three components explained roughly 90% of the variance within the dataset.

As we have seen before [@DOI:10.1101/778894], tensor factorization clearly separated the contribution of each dimension into each factor, and distinct responses into separate components. Component 1 almost exclusively represented responses in the cytokines that were not Fc-conjugated (Fig. [@fig:tfac]c) at high concentrations (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d). Its response was not cell specific across the four cell populations (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e) and relatively transient (Fig. [@fig:tfac]f). Interestingly, the remaining two components partly separated by whether cytokines were Fc-fused in a monovalent or bivalent form (Fig. [@fig:tfac]c), with the bivalent cytokines weighted more strongly by component 2, and the monovalent forms on component 3. Component 2 explained responses almost exclusive to regulatory T cells (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e) at lower concentrations (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d), while component 3 had a broad response (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e) and increased with concentration (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d). Despite these strong differences in specificities, and a difference in the timing for an initial response, both components were similarly sustained on longer timescales (Fig. [@fig:tfac]f).

While a large portion of the complexity of the γ~c~ signaling pathway is undoubtedly derived from the dynamics of intracellular signaling events, receptor trafficking, and other myriad other pathway mechanics, we sought to determine whether key differences in cell type specific response to IL-2 muteins could be explained through changes in simple surface receptor-ligand interactions. To do this, we employ a simple, equilibrium, multivalent binding model to predict cellular response to IL-2 muteins. This model has been shown to accurately predict the amount of monovalent, multivalent, and heterovalent ligand bound by cells expressing known quantities of receptors (Citation). Multivalent ligands differ in their receptor-ligand interactions in that multivalent molecules can bind multiple receptors simultanesouly. The core assumuption made by the model which allows it to predict the binding activity of multivalent ligands is that the initial ligand-receptor association proceeds with the same affinity as a monomeric ligand-receptor interaction with some dissocation constant, $K_d$. All subsequent ligand-receptor binding interactions are then allowed to proceed with an affinity which is scaled by the crosslinking constant, $K_x^*$. This constant is representative of the effects of changes in local ligand concentration, ligand linker flexibility, etc., and generally describes the propensity which a ligand has for binding multiple receptors. Using our PBMC receptor quantitation, cytokine signaling data, and receptor-ligand kinetics data simultaneously, we applied this model to predict the signaling activity of IL-2 muteins. 


### Multivalency provides a general strategy for enhanced binding selectivity

![**Multivalency can further improve specificity but requires coordinate affinity adjustments.** Affinities were allowed to vary between $K_D$s of 1e-2 and 1e4 nM, and $K_x$* was allowed to vary between 1e-13 and 1e-11 during optimizations. All optimizations were performed using a concentration of 1 nM. Selectivity was calculated as the ratio of predicted pSTAT5 in target cells to the mean pSTAT5 predicted in off-target cells. A,C,E) Optimal selectivities achieved for ligands of varying valency for $T_{reg}$s, NK cells, and $T_{helper}$ cells respectively. Selectivity for $T_{reg}$s and NK cells was derived from IL-2 muteins, and selectivity for $T_{helper}$s was calculated using IL-7 muteins. B,D,F) Optimal receptor-ligand dissociation constants for each ligand optimized for selectivity. Mutein affinity for IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ was allowed to vary for IL-2 muteins, and affinity for IL-7Rα was allowed to vary for IL-7 muteins. ](./output/figureC4.svg){#fig:opt}

The overarching objective of most γ~c~ cytokine therapeutic engineering efforts is to design a ligand which induces proliferation in select immune cell types, while reducing proliferation of off-target cell types. Having shown that with a simple, equilibrium, two-step binding model, we can accurately predict immune cell type specific response to IL-2 muteins, and that IL-2 muteins in the bivalent format may have favorable properties when targeting $T_{reg}$s, we sought to computationally explore how far the potential benefits conferred by multivalent cytokines could be exploited. While the amount of monovalent ligand bound by a cell varies linearly with its abundance of receptors, the amount of multivalent ligand bound displays a nonlinear relationship with cellular receptor abundance [@doi:10.1038/srep40098]. This means that multivalent ligands may be able to selectivity target cells based on their magnitude of receptor expression.

We have shown in previous work, that for optimal selectivity for a particular cell type to be achieved by engineering ligands of higher valencies, coordinate changes in receptor-ligand binding kinetics must be made [@DOI:10.1101/2020.11.25.398974]. Here, we define selectivity  for a particular cell type to be the ratio of predicted pSTAT5 response in thetarget cell type to the mean pSTAT5 response in off-target populations. By maximizing this function through changes to ligand valency and affinity, we produced theoretical design criteria for the design of ligands which will selectively activate cells of interest. We first found the optimal selectivity with regards to $T_{reg}$s using IL-2 muteins of varying valencies (Fig. {@fig:opt}a). Here, found that increases in ligand valency allowed for exponential increases in achievable selectivity, even past the bivalent cytokine format. The mechanism of this enhanced selectivity is revealed by the accompanying changes in affinity required to achieve these selectivities; ligands with low affinity for IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ and higher affinity for IL-2Rα display high selectivity for $T_{reg}$s (Fig. {@fig:opt}b). Interestingly, optimized IL-2 muteins of higher valencies required lower affinities for IL-2Rα. We then explored whether IL-2 muteins of higher valency could selectively target NK cells, with similar results; IL-2 muteins of higher valency allowed for highly selective activation of NK cells, given that ligand affinities were also tuned (Fig. {@fig:opt}c,d). Unsurprisingly, due to NK cells relatively high abundance of IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ and low abundance of IL-2Rα dictated that ligands with high affinity for IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ and low affinity for IL-2Rα conferred the highest degrees of selectivity for NK cells. Again, intermediate affinities for IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ were found to perform the best for ligands of higher valencies.

Finally, we sought to determine whether a similar approach for achieving cell type selective ligands could be used using IL-7 muteins. We explored whether $T_{helper}$ cells, which express high levels of IL-7Rα (Fig. {@fig:S1}i) could be targeted effectively with IL-7 muteins of high valency. We found that ligands of higher valency could achieve higher degrees of selectivity for these cells, but that the benefits of valency were reduced relative to the targeting of $T_{reg}$s or NK cells (Fig. {@fig:opt}e). These benefits were again found to be contingent on decreasing affinity of IL-7 muteins for IL-7Rα at higher valencies. In total, these results show that the interplay of effects which affinity modulation and valency can have on cellular binding could theoretically be exploited to design γ~c~ cytokines with extreme selectivity for particular cell types that cannot be achieved using monovalent or even bivalent ligands alone. They also show the potential benefit that the computational framework described above may have in guiding therapeutic development.
