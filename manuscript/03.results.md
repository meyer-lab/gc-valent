### Variation in receptor abundance drives variation in response

![**Possible effects of bivalent Fc-cytokine formats.** ](./output/figureC1.svg){#fig:mbEff}

Bivalent γ~c~ cytokines have been shown to display altered potency, and cell type selectivity signaling profiles in both _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ formats [@DOI:10.1016/j.jaut.2014.10.002, @DOI:10.1016/j.jaut.2018.10.017]. Bivalent ligands have generally shown to activate T~reg~s with greater avidity, while minimizing the signaling and proliferation of effector cell types, making them promising immunosuppressive therapeutics [@DOI:doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2014.01.008]. Despite these promising findings, the mechanism by which multivalency induces altered signaling compared to monovalent ligands in the γ~c~ signaling pathways has not yet been explored. The possible origins of the differences between monovalent and bivalent cytokine signaling profiles are varied.

Multivalent γ~c~ ligands may induce signaling through altered surface-receptor interactions (Fig. [@fig:mbEff]a). Receptor-ligand interactions are a necessary step in any signaling pathway - while monovalent ligands can only bind, and ultimately transduce signal through a single receptor complex, multivalent ligands can potentially engage two or more complexes simultaneously. This change in signaling activity ultimately leades to altered functional affinity, otherwise known as avidity. This altered avidity has been shown to drastically change the amount of ligand bound to cells expressing similar amounts of surface receptors [@DOI:10.1021/jacs.8b09198]. Avidity has also been shown to vary depending on the abundance of receptor displayed by a cell, an effect which can be harnessed to engineer cell type binding selectivity into a ligand [@pmid:29960887, @doi:10.1038/srep40098, @doi:10.1021/cb6003788]. These changes in binding phenomena likely contribute to observed differences in cell type response to mono- and bivalent γ~c~ ligands, and will be the focus of this paper.

Another possible phenomenon which may uniquely effect signaling response to multivalent γ~c~ ligands may be changes in signal transduction activity (Fig. [@fig:mbEff]b). Multivalent ligands, through binding of multiple receptor complexes, are known to increase local receptor localization, which can lead to increases in downstream signal transduction [@DOI:10.1002/anie.200502794]. This effect has been observed to be critical to signaling through integrin mediated signaling, B cell receptor based pathways, among others [@DOI:10.1126/scitranslmed.3001002, doi.org/10.1021/cb600489g, doi.org/10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80629-9]. While we will not explore the possible contributions that multivalent ligands enact on intracellular signal transduction in this work, it remains potentially an important determinant of mutlivalent signaling response, particularly at higher ligand valencies.

Finally, response to multivalent ligands may be governed by alterations in pharmacokinetics or ligand degredation kinetics (Fig. [@fig:mbEff]c). Wild-type γ~c~ ligands are rapidly cleared both renaly, and through receptor-mediated endocytosis, and thus their half-lives _in vivo_ are often an important design criterion [@pmid:11801561, @pmid:2317789, @DOI:doi.org/10.1002/eji.1830161125, @DOI:10.1084/jem.183.4.1587]. It has been shown that nanoparticles and ligands of higher valency are endocytosed through altered mechanisms, ultimately leading to changes in intracellular degradation rates [@DOI:10.1074/jbc.274.2.1164, @DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b08047]. It has also been shown that the pharmacokinetics and _in vivo_ half lives of ligands are modulated by their valency [@DOI:10.1016/j.jaut.2014.10.002, doi.org/10.1021/nn102278w]. These results suggest that alterations in cellular and physiological degradation of γ~c~ ligands may be affected by ligand valency format. However, while the pharmacokinetics and signal transduction of multivalent ligands may ultimately play a part in determining differences between cell type specific response to mono- and multivalent γ~c~ cytokine stimulation, here, we attempt to quantitatively unravel and determine determine what we suspect to be the critical role which multivalent receptor-ligand binding plays.


### Bivalent Fc-cytokine fusions have distinct cell specificity but not dynamics

Exploring how dynamic responses vary across responding cell types and ligand treatments is challenging due to the multi-dimensional contributions to differences in response. Restricting ones' view to a single time point, cell type, or ligand concentration provides only a slice of the picture [@DOI:10.1101/778894; @DOI:10.1101/2021.01.03.425138]. Therefore, we applied tensor factorization as a way to separate the contribution of each dimension in overall response.

We arranged our profiling experiments into a four-dimensional tensor, with each dimension varying the ligand used, treatment concentration, treatment duration, or cell type used in the profiling. We then factored this data using non-negative, canonical polyadic decomposition to derive factors summarizing the influence of each dimension. Three components explained roughly 90% of the variance within the dataset.

As we have seen before [@DOI:10.1101/778894], tensor factorization clearly separated the contribution of each dimension into each factor, and distinct responses into separate components. Component 1 almost exclusively represented responses in the cytokines that were not Fc-conjugated (Fig. [@fig:tfac]c) at high concentrations (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d). Its response was not cell specific across the four cell populations (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e) and relatively transient (Fig. [@fig:tfac]f). Interestingly, the remaining two components partly separated by whether cytokines were Fc-fused in a monovalent or bivalent form (Fig. [@fig:tfac]c), with the bivalent cytokines weighted more strongly by component 2, and the monovalent forms on component 3. Component 2 explained responses almost exclusive to regulatory T cells (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e) at lower concentrations (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d), while component 3 had a broad response (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e) and increased with concentration (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d). Despite these strong differences in specificities, and a difference in the timing for an initial response, both components were similarly sustained on longer timescales (Fig. [@fig:tfac]f).

While a large portion of the complexity of the γ~c~ signaling pathway is undoubtedly derived from the dynamics of intracellular signaling events, receptor trafficking, and other myriad other pathway mechanics, we sought to determine whether key differences in cell type specific response to IL-2 muteins could be explained through changes in simple surface receptor-ligand interactions. To do this, we employ a simple, equilibrium, multivalent binding model to predict cellular response to IL-2 muteins. This model has been shown to accurately predict the amount of monovalent, multivalent, and heterovalent ligand bound by cells expressing known quantities of receptors [@DOI:10.1016/j.cels.2018.05.018, @DOI:10.1101/2020.11.25.398974]. Multivalent ligands differ in their receptor-ligand interactions in that multivalent molecules can bind multiple receptors simultanesouly. The core assumuption made by the model which allows it to predict the binding activity of multivalent ligands is that the initial ligand-receptor association proceeds with the same affinity as a monomeric ligand-receptor interaction with some dissocation constant, $K_d$. All subsequent ligand-receptor binding interactions are then allowed to proceed with an affinity which is scaled by the crosslinking constant, $K_x^*$. This constant is representative of the effects of changes in local ligand concentration, ligand linker flexibility, etc., and generally describes the propensity which a ligand has for binding multiple receptors (see methods). By using our PBMC receptor quantitation, cytokine signaling data, and receptor-ligand kinetics data simultaneously, we applied this model to predict the signaling activity of IL-2 muteins.

In order to translate our multivalent binding model to predict immune cell signaling response to IL-2 mutein stimulation, several key assumptions were made. First, we allowed each IL-2 mutein monomer to bind both an IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ receptor in order to simulate the formation of the low and high affinity receptor-ligand complexes. By extension, bivalent IL-2 muteins are allowed by the model to bind two of each receptor. Another key assumption made by the model is that ligands do not bind to free γ~c~, as it has been shown that IL-2 binds free γ~c~ with very low affinity [10.1016/j.cytogfr.2006.07.003]. It is also assumed that all IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ is preassembled into dimers. Finally, we assume that signaling activity is linearly proportional to the amount of ligand bound to IL-2Rβ/γ~c~, as only complexes containing ligand and IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ enact signal transduction through the Jak/STAT pathway. We also assume that the scalar constant relating active signaling complexes and pSTAT5 signaling response is specific to each cell type, as the abundance of available STAT5 varies drastically between immmune cell types.

Using the above assumptions, we fit our model to our experimental signaling data at the 30 minute and one hour time points. Through fitting, we found an optimized value of $K_x^*$ of 2e-12, a value which is similar to $K_x^*$ values which were found to fit the model other binding phenomena [@DOI:10.1016/j.cels.2018.05.018, @DOI:10.1016/0025-5564(81)90036-5]. We also fit the scalar factors used to translate between active binding complexes on a per cell type and per flow cytometry experiment basis. The resulting predictions for all ligands, cell types, concentrations, and both time points were then compared to experimentall determined signaling values, and found to fit with an $R^2$ value of 0.89 (Fig. [@fig:tfac]a). This high accuracy was found to persist across cell types, and across ligands, for both mono- and bivalent ligands (Fig. [@fig:tfac]b-c), although the model was able to predict regulatory T cell response with the noticeably higher accuracy. In order to determine whether our model's ability to predict cellular response to bivalent ligands was dependent on the valency of the molecule, rather than solely the affinity of the molecule, we then fit the model to bivalent signaling data which was incorrectly labeled as monovalent data, and determined that accuracy with which the model could predict experimental signaling data. We found that incorrectly labeling bivalent signaling data as monovalent resulted in signficantly reduced model accuracy for all of our bivalent ligands, save for the bivalent WT IL-2 conjugated to the Fc fragment at the N-terminus, where the model was able to predict response with high accuracy regardless of input valency (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d). Thus, we show that the mechanistic effects of multivalent binding do play an important role in determining signaling response.

We then sought to determine whether our model was able to predict the $EC_{50}$ of our ligands (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e). Our model was able to recapitulate most trends in $EC_{50}$ across ligands, but lacked some quantitative accuracy. We did not predict the $EC_{50}$ of CD8 or NK cells, as the ligands used in this study were generally designed to reduce their activation, and subsequently, an $EC_{50}$ was unable to be fit to the experimental dose response curves. This problem is exemplified by the experimental $EC_{50}$s associated with H16N N-term, WT C-term, and V91K C-term responses, where the values were set to the bounds of the hill function's $EC_{50}$ fit $EC_{50}$ (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e). Finally, we examined how our model's accuracy varied with time, by fitting the model to each time point individually (Fig. [@fig:tfac]f). Unsurprsingly, the steady-state nature of our model, and high rates of receptor trafficking associated with the gamma-chain pathway resulted in reduced model accuracy at longer time points [@DOI:10.1007/s00262-004-0624-7]. The exclusion of time dynamics represents a shortcoming of our simple equilibrium binding model. In total however, our model is able to accurately reproduce cell type specific responses to IL-2 muteins, and represents a highly interpretable and efficient method for predicting the effects of possible gamma chain cytokine engineering efforts.


### Multivalency provides a general strategy for enhanced binding selectivity

![**Multivalency can further improve specificity but requires coordinate affinity adjustments.** Affinities were allowed to vary between $K_D$s of 1e-2 and 1e4 nM, and $K_x$* was allowed to vary between 1e-13 and 1e-11 during optimizations. All optimizations were performed using a concentration of 1 nM. Selectivity was calculated as the ratio of predicted pSTAT5 in target cells to the mean pSTAT5 predicted in off-target cells. A,C,E) Optimal selectivities achieved for ligands of varying valency for $T_{reg}$s, NK cells, and $T_{helper}$ cells respectively. Selectivity for $T_{reg}$s and NK cells was derived from IL-2 muteins, and selectivity for $T_{helper}$s was calculated using IL-7 muteins. B,D,F) Optimal receptor-ligand dissociation constants for each ligand optimized for selectivity. Mutein affinity for IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ was allowed to vary for IL-2 muteins, and affinity for IL-7Rα was allowed to vary for IL-7 muteins. ](./output/figureC4.svg){#fig:opt}

The overarching objective of most γ~c~ cytokine therapeutic engineering efforts is to design a ligand which induces proliferation in select immune cell types, while reducing proliferation of off-target cell types. Having shown that with a simple, equilibrium, two-step binding model, we can accurately predict immune cell type specific response to IL-2 muteins, and that IL-2 muteins in the bivalent format may have favorable properties when targeting $T_{reg}$s, we sought to computationally explore how far the potential benefits conferred by multivalent cytokines could be exploited. While the amount of monovalent ligand bound by a cell varies linearly with its abundance of receptors, the amount of multivalent ligand bound displays a nonlinear relationship with cellular receptor abundance [@doi:10.1038/srep40098]. This means that multivalent ligands may be able to selectivity target cells based on their magnitude of receptor expression.

We have shown in previous work, that for optimal selectivity for a particular cell type to be achieved by engineering ligands of higher valencies, coordinate changes in receptor-ligand binding kinetics must be made [@DOI:10.1101/2020.11.25.398974]. Here, we define selectivity  for a particular cell type to be the ratio of predicted pSTAT5 response in thetarget cell type to the mean pSTAT5 response in off-target populations. By maximizing this function through changes to ligand valency and affinity, we produced theoretical design criteria for the design of ligands which will selectively activate cells of interest. We first found the optimal selectivity with regards to $T_{reg}$s using IL-2 muteins of varying valencies (Fig. [{@fig:opt}]a). Here, found that increases in ligand valency allowed for exponential increases in achievable selectivity, even past the bivalent cytokine format. The mechanism of this enhanced selectivity is revealed by the accompanying changes in affinity required to achieve these selectivities; ligands with low affinity for IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ and higher affinity for IL-2Rα display high selectivity for $T_{reg}$s (Fig. [@fig:opt}]b). Interestingly, optimized IL-2 muteins of higher valencies required lower affinities for IL-2Rα. We then explored whether IL-2 muteins of higher valency could selectively target NK cells, with similar results; IL-2 muteins of higher valency allowed for highly selective activation of NK cells, given that ligand affinities were also tuned (Fig. [{@fig:opt}]c,d). Unsurprisingly, due to NK cells relatively high abundance of IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ and low abundance of IL-2Rα dictated that ligands with high affinity for IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ and low affinity for IL-2Rα conferred the highest degrees of selectivity for NK cells. Again, intermediate affinities for IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ were found to perform the best for ligands of higher valencies.

Finally, we sought to determine whether a similar approach for achieving cell type selective ligands could be used using IL-7 muteins. We explored whether $T_{helper}$ cells, which express high levels of IL-7Rα (Fig. [{@fig:S1}]i) could be targeted effectively with IL-7 muteins of high valency. We found that ligands of higher valency could achieve higher degrees of selectivity for these cells, but that the benefits of valency were reduced relative to the targeting of $T_{reg}$s or NK cells (Fig. [{@fig:opt}]e). These benefits were again found to be contingent on decreasing affinity of IL-7 muteins for IL-7Rα at higher valencies. In total, these results show that the interplay of effects which affinity modulation and valency can have on cellular binding could theoretically be exploited to design γ~c~ cytokines with extreme selectivity for particular cell types that cannot be achieved using monovalent or even bivalent ligands alone. They also show the potential benefit that the computational framework described above may have in guiding therapeutic development.
