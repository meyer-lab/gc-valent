### Bivalent Fc-cytokine fusions have distinct cell specificity but not dynamics

![**pSTAT5 response varies in a cell type- and treatment-specific manner.** A)  Schematic representation of CP decomposition. Experimental pSTAT5 measurements are arranged in a tensor depending upon the time, ligand, cytokine concentration, and cell type. CP decomposition then helps to visualize this space. B) Percent variance reconstructed (R2X) versus the number of components used in non-negative CP decomposition. C) Component values versus cytokine. D) Component value by cytokine concentration.

Exploring how dynamic responses vary across responding cell types and ligand treatments is challenging due to the multi-dimensional contributions to differences in response. Restricting ones' view to a single time point, cell type, or ligand concentration provides only a slice of the picture [@DOI:10.1101/778894; @DOI:10.1101/2021.01.03.425138]. Therefore, we applied tensor factorization as a way to separate the contribution of each dimension in overall response.

We arranged our profiling experiments into a four-dimensional tensor, with each dimension varying the ligand used, treatment concentration, treatment duration, or cell type used in the profiling. We then factored this data using non-negative, canonical polyadic decomposition to derive factors summarizing the influence of each dimension. Three components explained roughly 90% of the variance within the dataset.

As we have seen before [@DOI:10.1101/778894], tensor factorization clearly separated the contribution of each dimension into each factor, and distinct responses into separate components. Component 1 almost exclusively represented responses in the cytokines that were not Fc-conjugated (Fig. [@fig:tfac]c) at high concentrations (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d). Its response was not cell specific across the four cell populations (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e) and relatively transient (Fig. [@fig:tfac]f). Interestingly, the remaining two components partly separated by whether cytokines were Fc-fused in a monovalent or bivalent form (Fig. [@fig:tfac]c), with the bivalent cytokines weighted more strongly by component 2, and the monovalent forms on component 3. Component 2 explained responses almost exclusive to regulatory T cells (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e) at lower concentrations (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d), while component 3 had a broad response (Fig. [@fig:tfac]e) and increased with concentration (Fig. [@fig:tfac]d). Despite these strong differences in specificities, and a difference in the timing for an initial response, both components were similarly sustained on longer timescales (Fig. [@fig:tfac]f).


### Difference in cell response is explained by a simple, multivalent binding model

![**Immune cell type specific response is predicted by a simple multivalent equilibrium binding model.** All accuracies in figure are calculated for experimental cyokine responses at the 30 minute and one hour time points. A) Experimentally measured pSTAT5 responses vs. predicted pSTAT5 responses for all cell types, ligands, and concentrations. B) Model's accuracy (R^2 score) by cell type for all mono- and bivalent IL-2 muteins. C) Model's accuracy (R^2 score) by cytokine for all cell types. D) Model's accuracy (R^2 score) when predicting the responses of all cell types to bivalent ligands either correctly as dimers, or as IL-2 monomers. E) Experimentally determined (dots) versus predicted (crosses) EC_50_s for all IL-2 muteins. F) Model's accuracy (R^2) score when fit to and predicting pSTAT5 response to cytokines at each time point. Accuracy for all concentrations and cell types is shown.](./output/figureC3.svg){#fig:mbMod}



### Multivalency provides a general strategy for enhanced binding selectivity

![**Multivalency can further improve specificity but requires coordinate affinity adjustments.** Affinities were allowed to vary between $K_D$s of 1e-2 and 1e4 nM, and $K_x$* was allowed to vary between 1e-13 and 1e-11 during optimizations. All optimizations were performed using a concentration of 1 nM. Selectivity was calculated as the ratio of predicted pSTAT5 in target cells to the mean pSTAT5 predicted in off-target cells. A,C,E) Optimal selectivities achieved for ligands of varying valency for $T_{reg}$s, NK cells, and $T_{helper}$ cells respectively. Selectivity for $T_{reg}$s and NK cells was derived from IL-2 muteins, and selectivity for $T_{helper}$s was calculated using IL-7 muteins. B,D,F) Optimal receptor-ligand dissociation constants for each ligand optimized for selectivity. Mutein affinity for IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ was allowed to vary for IL-2 muteins, and affinity for IL-7Rα was allowed to vary for IL-7 muteins. ](./output/figureC4.svg){#fig:opt}
