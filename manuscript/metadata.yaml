title: "Multivalency enhances the specificity of Fc-cytokine fusions"
One Sentence Summary: Here, we show that multivalency is a key determininant of the cell type selectivity of IL-2 muteins, and that the mechanism of this selectivity can be explained using a simple equilibrium, multivalent binding model which predicts that the benefits of multivalency can be further exploited to enhance IL-2 mutein selectivity.
