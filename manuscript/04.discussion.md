## Discussion

<!-- What we found (brief summary sentence) -->

The work described here serves as a demonstration of the critical, unexplored effect of ligand valency plays in the IL-2 cell-type-specific signaling pathway. We first used an unbiased, tensor-based dimensionality reduction technique to identify how patterns of immune cell response are dictated by various IL-2 mutein characteristics. Bivalent IL-2-Fc fusions were found to be highly selective for T~reg~ cells, even above the selectivity displayed by the same IL-2 mutein in a monovalent format (Fig. {@fig:tfac}). In order to understand this trend mechanistically, we then used a two-step, equilibrium, multivalent binding model to model cell type specific responses to a panel of IL-2 and IL-2 muteins, and were able to make highly accurate immune cell-specific response predictions. Finally, the model's potential utility as a tool for guiding the engineering of super-selective ligands of higher valency was demonstrated. Using mathematical optimization, we demonstrated that, with coordinate changes to affinity, higher valency IL-2 ligands were able to display greater optimal selectivity for either T~reg~s or NK cells, and that engineering of higher-valency IL-7 ligands may prove useful in designing a T~helper~ selective therapy (Fig. {@fig:opt}).

The accuracy of the multivalent, equilibrium binding model employed here serves to demonstrate the high degree to which the altered avidity of multivalent ligands explains their unique cell-type-specific signaling profiles. While it is known that multivalency can alter signaling activity through a variety of mechanisms, including altered signal transduction, pharmacokinetics, and trafficking dynamics, the accuracy of our binding model suggests that the unique signaling activities displayed by multivalent ligands can be largely explained by their altered avidities [@DOI:10.1002/anie.200502794; @DOI:10.7554/eLife.22882; @PMID:9873065; @PMID:25457307](Fig. {@fig:mbMod}). The mechanistic nature of the model furthers its utility in deconvoluting the mechanisms of cell-type-specific response to multivalent ligands; for example, we were able to determine that the selectivity which bivalent molecules have for T~reg~s arises as a result of this cell type's high abundance of IL-2Rα, which increased the avidity with which they bind multivalent IL-2 variants relative to cells with lower densities of IL-2Rα.

The multivalent, equilibrium binding described here also represents a versatile tool for exploring the potential benefits which valency engineering has in designing therapeutics with greater cell-type-selectivity. By optimizing the predicted selectivity of high-valency ligands, our model showed that multivalent IL-2 muteins may potentially be used to design more effective IL-2 based therapeutics for use in the clinical setting, where γ~c~ cytokine-based therapies have traditionally struggled [@DOI:10.1200/JCO.1991.9.4.694]. For example, our work here may be used to guide the design of multivalent IL-2 ligands with high selectively for T~reg~s, an important design criterion considered in the design of IL-2 based treatments for autoimmune diseases [@DOI:10.1016/j.jaut.2018.10.017; @DOI:0.1016/j.immuni.2015.04.015; @DOI:10.1038/s41392-017-0002-5]. Combined with the superior _in vivo_ half-life conferred by Fc-conjugated IL-2 muteins, these multivalent therapeutics could potentially be used in an out-patient setting and require less frequent dosing. We also demonstrated the potential benefit which multivalency may confer in the selective activation of NK cells, which could lead to similarly improved anti-cancer treatments [@DOI:10.1038/s41586-018-0830-7].

<!--  Problems, concessions. (needs extensive binding and cell type characterization, not necessarily translated in vivo, protein design challenge). -->

While our model does effectively capture cell type specific response to IL-2 and IL-2 muteins and can be readily applied to other well-studied signaling families, several challenges in its implementation and applications remain. First, the model requires extensive characterization of both the signaling family itself, and of the pertinent cell types involved in signaling which drive therapeutic and off-target effects [@DOI:10.1016/j.cels.2018.05.018]. Our model requires the isolation of these cell types and subsequent quantification of their receptor abundances. Binding analysis is also reliant on characterization and quantification of receptor-ligand kinetics. Several challenges in applying our model's findings to therapeutic ligand design also remain. While our can be used to model generate actionable guidelines for the modulation of receptor-ligand interactions in conjunction with valency engineering to design more selective ligands, precision engineering of ligand affinities remains a complicated protein engineering challenge [@DOI:10.1146/annurev-immunol-032713-120211]. The challenge of fabricating stable ligands of high valency also poses significant challenges to the implementation of the super-selective, high valency ligands proposed in our analysis [@DOI:10.1016/j.jim.2017.05.008]. Furthermore, we have not yet experimentally validated whether the advantages conferred by bivalent ligands _in vitro_ translate to _in vivo_ settings.

 <!--  Summary (problem addressed, results, future directions.) -->

The design of cell-type-selective ligands is complicated by the complex signaling processes by which they induce cellular signaling and ultimately response, which leads to a combinatorial explosion of potential ligand design objectives [@DOI:10.1016/j.cell.2017.08.015]. We have shown that, through use of tensor factorization analysis of immune cell response to IL-2 muteins that multivalency may confer desirable qualities to engineered cytokines. Then, through use of a simple, multivalent binding model, we showed that surface receptor-ligand interactions play a governing role in explaining cell type specific signaling activity. We then used our model to generate ligand design criteria for more selective, high-valency IL-2 ligands, revealing an inexpensive computational tool for guiding the engineering of cell-type-selective therapeutics. Our approach here may be applied to engineer selectivity into other signaling systems characterized by pleiotropy, such as the IL-4/IL-13 or TNF systems [@DOI:10.1126/science.1085458; @DOI:10.1073/pnas.1520175113]
