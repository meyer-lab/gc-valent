## Discussion

<!-- What we found (brief summary sentence) -->

Here, we have systematically explored how ligand properties determine signaling response across 13 IL-2 and IL-2 muteins, including both monovalent and bivalent Fc fusion variants. A tensor-based dimensionality reduction technique identified the patterns of changing response with ligand properties, revealing that multivalent cytokines have unique specificity but identical dynamics (Fig. {@fig:tfac}). A multivalent binding model was able to accurately reproduce cell type specific response to IL-2 muteins with high accuracy, indicating that specificity is derived from surface binding avidity effects (Fig. {@fig:mbMod}). Through this model, we found that cytokines of higher valency offer even greater cell type selectivity given corresponding affinity adjustments, which should translate to therapies of improved potency and reduced toxicity (Fig. {@fig:opt}).

The design of cell-type-selective ligands is complicated by the complex signaling processes by which they induce cellular signaling and ultimately response, which leads to a combinatorial explosion of potential ligand design objectives [@DOI:10.1016/j.cell.2017.08.015]. This work serves to demonstrate the importance of the relatively unexplored axis of ligand development represented by the design of multivalent ligands. Multivalent ligands have several documented effects, including altered signal transduction [@DOI:10.1002/anie.200502794; @DOI:10.7554/eLife.22882.001], binding avidity, and pharmacokinetics [@DOI:10.1016/j.tibtech.2010.03.007] or intracellular trafficking [@DOI:10.1074/jbc.274.2.1164].  While valency has been extensively explored as a means to introduce binding selectivity based on receptor density [@PMID:30507196; @DOI:10.1021/cb6003788], how this effect interacts with the presence of multiple receptor species and cell signaling is surely more complex. The ability of the binding model described in this work to accurately predict immune cell-type-specific response indicates that the cell-type-specific signaling profiles of these cytokines can still be understood as principally arising through receptor avidity effects at the cell surface (Fig. {@fig:mbMod}). 

<!--- Therapeutic development and applications -->

Our work here may be used to guide the design of IL-2 muteins with high selectively for T~reg~s, an important design criterion considered in the design of IL-2 based treatments for autoimmune diseases [@DOI:10.1016/j.jaut.2018.10.017; @DOI:10.1038/s41392-017-0002-5]. By optimizing the predicted selectivity of high-valency ligands, we showed that multivalency may be exploited to design more effective IL-2 based therapeutics for use in the clinical setting, where IL-2 based therapies have traditionally struggled (Fig. {@fig:opt}a,b) [@DOI:10.1200/JCO.1991.9.4.694]. Combined with the superior _in vivo_ half-life conferred by Fc-conjugated IL-2 muteins, these multivalent therapeutics could potentially be used in an out-patient setting and require less frequent dosing [@DOI:10.1086/515653]. Furthermore, the superior selectivity offered by engineered multivalent ligands will likely further increase their _in vivo_ half-lives, due to a reduction in receptor-mediated clearance by off-target populations. We also demonstrated the potential benefit which multivalency may confer in the selective activation of NK cells, which could lead to similarly improved anti-cancer treatments [@DOI:10.1038/s41586-018-0830-7]. Our approach here may also be applied to engineer selectivity into other signaling pathways characterized by cell type pleiotropy, such as IL-4/IL-13 or TNF systems [@DOI:10.1126/science.1085458; @DOI:10.1073/pnas.1520175113].

<!--- Complications and future directions -->

While our approach does effectively capture cell type specific responses to IL-2 and IL-2 muteins and can be readily applied to other well-studied signaling families, several challenges in its implementation and broad translation to therapeutic development remain. Our model can be used to model generate guidelines for the modulation of receptor-ligand interactions in conjunction with valency engineering to design more selective ligands, but also predicts that there are specific receptor affinities for are required to achieve these benefits (Fig. {@fig:opt}). While a host of methods have been developed and employed to enhance or ablate cytokine affinity for receptor subunits [@DOI:10.1146/annurev-immunol-032713-120211], precisely tuning ligand affinities remains a complicated protein engineering challenge. Furthermore, we have not yet experimentally validated whether the advantages conferred by higher valency ligands _in vitro_ translate to _in vivo_ settings. For example, a research group found that while a bivalent IL-2 molecule conjugated to a diphtheria based toxin showed an enhanced ability to target and eliminate T~reg~s in an _in vitro_ setting [@DOI:10.1016/j.jim.2014.01.008], its enhanced selectivity failed to be replicated in _in vivo_ trials, and did not eliminate T~reg~s any more selectively than its monovalent counterpart [@DOI:10.1016/j.jim.2017.05.008]. In contrast, the increased efficacy and reduced toxicity of a bivalent EGFR-based therapy over its monovalent counterpart in an in vivo setting was demonstrated by the same group, suggesting that the specificity conferred by multivalent ligands can indeed transfer to clinical settings [@DOI:10.1002/1878-0261.12919]. This discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro selectivity indicates that further experimental modeling is undoubtedly necessary to explore the in vivo benefits of multivalent IL-2 therapies.
