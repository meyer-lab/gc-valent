## Introduction

The cytokines binding the common γ-chain (γ~c~) receptor, including interleukin (IL)-2, 4, 7, 9, 15, and 21, are a critical hub in modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. The cytokine family operates through a common theme of binding private receptors for each ligand, before engaging the common γ~c~ receptor to induce signaling. A prominent phenotypic outcome of γ~c~ receptor signaling is lymphoproliferation, and so the cytokines are often observed to be an endogenous or exogenous mechanism for altering the balance of immune cell types. This phenotype is observed most extremely from loss-of-function or reduced activity mutations in gc which subvert T and NK cell maturation. Disruptive mutations in private receptors can lead to more selective reductions in cell types such as regulatory T cells (T~reg~s) with IL-2Rα or T cells with IL-7Rα. Conversely, activating mutations in these receptors, such as IL-7Rα promote cancers such as B and T cell leukemias.


Understanding the signaling processes involved.


How engineered forms vary.


Here, we systematically and comprehensively evaluate the signaling specificity effects of engineered cytokine alterations, including affinity-altering mutations and Fc-fusion formats. We explore three hypotheses for the widely observed effect that Fc-fusion in a bivalent format enhances potency _in vivo_. We find that this can be fully explained by the effect multivalency has on binding selectivity toward cells with higher receptor abundance. The signaling specificity of all muteins and Fc-formats match well with a multivalent binding model, both between cell types and across cell-to-cell variation within a cell type. Finally, we argue that cytokine valency is an unexplored axis of further enhancing selective signaling responses, and that many opportunities for using multivalency exist within the γ~c~ cytokine family.
