## Introduction






Here, we systematically and comprehensively evaluate the signaling specificity effects of engineered cytokine alterations, including affinity-altering mutations and Fc-fusion formats. We explore three hypotheses for the widely observed effect that Fc-fusion in a bivalent format enhances potency _in vivo_. We find that this can be fully explained by the effect multivalency has on binding selectivity toward cells with higher receptor abundance. The signaling specificity of all muteins and Fc-formats match well with a multivalent binding model, both between cell types and across cell-to-cell variation within a cell type. Finally, we argue that cytokine valency is an unexplored axis of further enhancing selective signaling responses, and that many opportunities for using multivalency exist within the Î³~c~ cytokine family.
