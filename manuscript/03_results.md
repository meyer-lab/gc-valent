### Variation in receptor abundance drives variation in response

![**Receptor variation drives variation in response.** (A) Diagram of challenge. While technologies enable widespread single cell quantification, it is typically in the same population, but not the same cells. (B-E) Principal components analysis (PCA) scores (B-D) and loadings (E) for T~reg~s profiled for pSTAT5 response to IL-2. (F–I) PCA scores (F–H) and leadings (I) for NK cells profiled for pSTAT5 response to IL-2. (J–M) Dose response profile of effector T (J), regulatory T (K), helper T (L), and NK (M) cells.](./output/figureB1.svg){#fig:B1}
