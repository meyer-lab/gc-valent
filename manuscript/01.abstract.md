## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The common γ-chain cytokines are promising immune therapies due to their central role in coordinating the proliferation and activity of various immune cell populations. One of these cytokines, interleukin (IL)-2, has potential as a therapy in autoimmunity but is limited in effectiveness by its modest specificity toward regulatory T cells (T~reg~s). IL-2 muteins with altered receptor-ligand binding kinetics can improve the cell type selectivity of the signaling response. Furthermore, therapeutic ligands are often made dimeric as antibody Fc fusions to confer desirable pharmacokinetic benefits, with under-explored consequences on signaling. Here, we sought to systematically profile the signaling responses to a wide variety of wild type and mutein IL-2 molecules in various Fc fusion configurations. We used a tensor-structured dimensionality reduction scheme to decompose the responses of each cell population to each ligand over a range of time points and cytokine concentrations. We found that dimeric muteins are uniquely specific for T~reg~s at intermediate ligand concentrations, a desirable quality for immunosuppressive drugs. To dissect the mechanism of enhanced T~reg~ specificity in dimeric ligands, we compared signaling response across all treatments to a simple, two-step multivalent binding model. Our model was able to predict cellular responses with high accuracy. Bivalent Fc fusions display enhanced specificity and potency for T~reg~s through avidity effects toward IL-2Rα, and this enhancement is distinct from what can be achieved by mutein affinity changes. We consequently show that ligands engineered in even higher valency formats should possess greater potential for cell-type-selective signaling. In total, these findings represent a comprehensive analysis of how ligand properties, and their consequent effects on surface receptor-ligand interactions, translate to selective activation of immune cell populations. It also identifies a new route toward engineering even more selective therapeutic cytokines.

## Summary points

- The effect of multivalency is potentially explained through multiple processes.
- Bivalent IL-2 displays distinct cell type selectivity but not dynamics.
- A simple multivalent binding model explains the differences between monovalent and bivalent IL-2.
- Model reveals that valency is an independent route for engineering specific IL-2 responses.
