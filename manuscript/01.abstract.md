## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The cytokines that interact with the common γ-chain cytokine receptor, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, have existing uses and future promise as immunotherapeutic agents. The therapeutic potential of these ligands is most often limited not by their potency, but by insufficient selectivity in the face of considerable off-target toxicities. These potentials and limitations have inspired a variety of engineering approaches, including mutein ligands with altered receptor binding kinetics and Fc-fused molecules for improved pharmacokinetics, sometimes with surprising potency or off-target effects. Here, we take aim to systematically profile the signaling response to a wide variety of wild-type and mutein IL-2 molecules in various Fc-fusion configurations. Using data-driven and mechanistic analysis to explore the sources of signaling specificity, we determine that the vast majority of signaling specificity can be explained using a simple model of multivalent receptor binding. More specifically, bivalent Fc-fusions display enhanced specificity and potency for regulatory T cells through avidity effects toward IL-2Rα, and this enhancement is distinct from what can be acheived by mutein affinity changes. We propose that variation in the valency of therapeutic cytokine interventions is an unexplored axis for optimizing the potency and toxicity of these agents.

## Summary points

- IL-2 receptor abundance and responses are highly heterogeneous
- Both receptor and response measurements can be treated as samples from a multivariate distribution
- Propagation of moments enables prediction and fitting between diverse models and single cell measurements
- Variation in each IL-2 receptor produces distinct patterns of cell-to-cell heterogeneity
- Fitting the variation in response can refine cell signaling models
